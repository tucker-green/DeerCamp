# NOW - Season Opener (0-3 months)

## 🎯 Priority: Get the fundamentals rock solid - like a well-sighted rifle

### 1. Stand Reservation System 🪜

**The Problem We're Solving:**
Every club deals with this: It's 4:30am opening day, you park your truck, and realize someone else is already walking to "your" stand. The group text from last night got buried. Now what? Drive to the backup spot? Miss the morning hunt arguing? This kills the whole morning.

**What Hunters Actually Need:**

#### **A. The Stand Board - Digital Version**
Remember the old corkboard at camp with cards pinned for each stand? This is that, but it actually works.

- **Visual calendar** showing every stand, every day
- **Color-coded status**: Green (open), Red (taken), Yellow (maintenance), Orange (guest hunting)
- **Moon phase overlay** on calendar (we all plan around the moon anyway)
- **Weather forecast integration** (wind direction matters for stand selection)
- **Sunrise/sunset times** automatically calculated for your location
- **"Opening Weekend" protection** - set rules for how prime dates get allocated

#### **B. Fair Rotation System**
Because the same guys shouldn't get the honey holes every weekend.

- **Automatic rotation tracking** - "Jim had Oak Ridge last Saturday, so he's last priority this weekend"
- **Seniority points** system (if your club uses it)
- **Draw system** for prime dates (opening day, rut peak, etc.)
- **"First come first served" mode** for clubs that prefer it
- **Youth hunter priority** settings
- **Earned time** - show up for work days, get bonus booking priority

#### **C. Real-World Booking Rules**
Every club has its own culture. The system should bend to you, not the other way around.

- **24-hour advance booking minimum** (prevent morning-of grabs)
- **Maximum consecutive days** (don't be that guy)
- **Blackout dates** (nobody hunts during annual work weekend)
- **Guest booking restrictions** (members only during prime time)
- **Auto-release** (if you no-show twice, your future bookings get canceled)
- **Weather cancellation** (release stands if severe weather hits)

#### **D. The Check-In Board**
Know who's in the woods RIGHT NOW.

- **Quick check-in/check-out** (tap your stand when you arrive/leave)
- **"Currently Hunting" live dashboard** - see who's where in real-time
- **Safety zones** - shows stands that are too close to hunt simultaneously
- **Overdue alerts** - if someone doesn't check out, notify emergency contacts
- **Text notification** - "John just checked into Oak Stand" (so you don't walk that direction)

**Hunter Stories (Real Scenarios):**
- *"I'm driving to camp Friday night. I want to reserve South Ridge for Saturday morning, but if there's a north wind, I'll take Creek Bottom instead. Can I see the forecast?"*
- *"My son has his first buck tag. Can I block off the food plot stand for him opening weekend before anyone else books it?"*
- *"We've got 15 members and only 8 stands. How do we make sure everyone gets fair chances at the good spots?"*
- *"Someone left a stand reserved for 3 weeks straight but never showed up. How do we handle that?"*

### 2. Brotherhood Management 👥

**The Problem We're Solving:**
You know that Excel spreadsheet your club treasurer has? The one nobody can find? With last year's phone numbers? That gets corrupted every hunting season? Yeah, we're fixing that.

**What Makes a Hunting Club Work:**

#### **A. The Member Roster - Camp Edition**
Not a boring database. A living record of your brotherhood.

- **Member profiles** with the info that matters:
  - Hunting experience level (rookie to old-timer)
  - Preferred weapon (rifle, bow, muzzleloader, crossbow)
  - Special certifications (tracking, meat processing, guide license)
  - Emergency contact (because stuff happens)
  - Blood type (for serious emergencies)
  - Dietary restrictions (for camp meals)
  - Vehicle info (make/model/plate for gate access)
  - Tree stand safety harness certification date

- **Roles that make sense**:
  - **Camp Boss** (owns the property/lease, final say)
  - **Treasurer** (handles the money)
  - **Game Warden** (tracks harvest, reports to state)
  - **Work Captain** (organizes property maintenance)
  - **Full Member** (voting rights, full access)
  - **Associate Member** (hunt rights, limited booking)
  - **Family Member** (spouse/kids of full members)
  - **Youth Hunter** (under 18, special rules)
  - **Guest** (one-time or seasonal access)
  - **Alumni** (former members, honorary access)

#### **B. The Prospect System**
Because bringing in new blood is how camps survive.

- **Prospect application** process
  - Submit online application
  - Upload hunter safety certificate
  - Provide references (other members vouch for you)
  - Pay application fee (covers background check)

- **Guest hunt trial period**
  - Let prospects hunt 1-3 times before voting them in
  - Track their behavior (leave stands clean? Follow rules? Safe?)
  - Existing members can leave feedback

- **Voting system**
  - Full members vote on new members
  - Can require unanimous, 2/3 majority, or simple majority
  - Anonymous voting option
  - Blackball provision (if your club uses it)

- **Onboarding checklist for new members**:
  - [ ] Pay initiation fee
  - [ ] Pay dues
  - [ ] Sign liability waiver
  - [ ] Complete property orientation
  - [ ] Meet all current members
  - [ ] Learn stand locations
  - [ ] Review club rules
  - [ ] Get gate code/key
  - [ ] Add to emergency contact list

#### **C. Dues & Finances**
Nobody likes chasing down money.

- **Automatic dues reminders** (email/text before due date)
- **Online payment** (credit card, bank transfer, Venmo, PayPal)
- **Payment plans** (split annual dues into monthly payments)
- **Late fee automation** (don't make the treasurer be the bad guy)
- **Work day credits** (reduce dues if you show up for maintenance)
- **Per-harvest fees** (if your club charges them)
- **Guest fees** (daily/weekend/seasonal rates)
- **Equipment damage deposits**
- **Expense reimbursements** (bought mineral for the food plot? Submit receipt)
- **Budget tracking** (lease payment, insurance, fuel, seed, feed)
- **Financial reports** (treasurer can pull P&L anytime)
- **Tax documents** (generate 1099s if needed for contractors)

#### **D. The Invitation System**
Word-of-mouth is how good camps grow.

- **Referral tracking** (who brought who in - matters for vouching)
- **Guest pass generation** (send friend a day pass with QR code)
- **Family sharing** (members can invite spouse/kids easily)
- **Corporate groups** (some camps host business clients)
- **Charity hunts** (veteran's day, kids with cancer, etc.)

**Hunter Stories:**
- *"My buddy wants to join. How do I get him on the list for next year's member vote?"*
- *"Three guys haven't paid dues since last season. Can I auto-suspend their booking rights until they pay?"*
- *"My son just turned 16 and got his license. How do I add him as a youth member?"*
- *"We want to do a Heroes Hunt for disabled vets next spring. How do I track those guest hunts separately?"*

### 3. The Compound Map 🗺️

**The Problem We're Solving:**
New member shows up opening morning. "Where's the Oak Stand?" Nobody's up to show them. They wander around in the dark. Spook deer. Get lost. Everyone's pissed.

**What a Hunting Map Needs to Be:**

#### **A. Property Intelligence**
This isn't just a map. It's institutional knowledge.

- **Satellite view with property boundaries** (no trespassing on accident)
- **Every stand marked with custom pins**:
  - Stand name
  - Stand type (ladder, climber, blind, box, ground)
  - Height
  - Capacity (1-person or 2-person)
  - Condition (good, needs repair, unsafe)
  - Last maintenance date
  - Which direction it faces
  - Best wind directions for that stand
  - Photo of the stand
  - Photo of the shooting lanes
  - Photo of the view from the stand

- **Access routes marked**:
  - Driving routes (which stands you can drive to)
  - Walking trails (blazed paths)
  - Quiet approaches (how to sneak in without spooking deer)
  - ATV trails
  - Seasonal routes (creek crossings in dry season only)

- **Food plots mapped**:
  - Plot name
  - Acreage
  - What's planted
  - When it was planted
  - Watering schedule
  - Expected maturity date
  - Photos of growth progress

- **Key terrain features**:
  - Water sources (creeks, ponds, springs)
  - Bedding areas (don't walk through these!)
  - Oak groves (acorn crops)
  - Thickets
  - Ridge lines
  - Funnels and pinch points
  - Scrape areas (deer sign)
  - Rub lines
  - Historical kill zones ("big buck was shot here last year")

#### **B. Layered Intel**
Turn it on and off like onX Hunt.

- **Wind overlay** (current wind direction, see if your stand is viable)
- **Topographic lines** (elevation matters)
- **Timber type** (hardwood vs pine)
- **Distance rings** (200, 300, 400 yards from stands)
- **Shot distance markers** (known yardages to shooting lanes)
- **Trail camera locations**
- **Mineral station locations**
- **Feeder locations** (where legal)
- **Property line buffer zones** (how close to edges)
- **Private land boundaries** (neighbor's property)

#### **C. Offline Works**
Because cell service in the woods is trash.

- **Download maps for offline use**
- **GPS still works without cell service**
- **Share offline map packages** (send to new members)
- **Print full-size maps** (laminate them for the camp wall)

#### **D. Smart Features**
The stuff that makes you look like a pro.

- **"Show me the best stand for a NW wind"** - auto-filters stands
- **"Which stands can I drive to?"** - highlights access
- **"Where are the closest two stands to Oak Ridge?"** - distance calculator
- **"Show me everywhere we've seen big bucks"** - heat map of sightings
- **Measure distance** - tap two points, get yardage
- **Record tracks** - GPS tracks your walk in/out (learn the quiet routes)

**Hunter Stories:**
- *"I've got a west wind tomorrow morning. Which stand should I hunt?"*
- *"New guy is hunting South Stand. How do I show him the walking trail so he doesn't drive the truck back there and spook everything?"*
- *"We need to add the new box blind we built last month."*
- *"Where exactly was that rub line we found during shed season?"*

# NEXT - Peak Season (3-6 months)

## 🦌 Priority: Build the community, grow the brotherhood, honor the heritage

### 7. The Camp Feed - Where Hunters Connect 🤝

**The Problem We're Solving:**
Hunting is lonely. You sit in a tree for 4 hours. Even if nothing happens, you've got stories. You need your people to share it with. This is the digital version of sitting around the campfire swapping tales.

**What the Feed Needs to Feel Like:**

#### **A. Story Sharing - The Way Hunters Tell It**

This isn't Instagram. This is different. It's about the HUNT, not the likes.

- **Hunt reports**:
  - "Sat Oak Stand this morning, 28° and perfect wind"
  - Add photos from the stand (sunrise, view, selfie)
  - Tag the stand location
  - Tag weather conditions (so others see the pattern)
  - Describe what you saw
  - Share lessons learned

- **Success stories**:
  - Harvest announcement with photos
  - The whole story: "Was about to climb down, then heard a grunt..."
  - Tag the members who helped
  - Link to the official harvest log entry
  - Congratulations from other members

- **Near-misses and lessons**:
  - "Buck came in downwind, busted me at 40 yards"
  - Teaching moments (what would you do different?)
  - Others share their similar experiences
  - Builds collective wisdom

- **Trail cam highlights**:
  - "Check out this giant from last night!"
  - Auto-tag the date/time/location from trail cam data
  - Others chime in with their sightings of same deer
  - "That's the same buck I saw from Creek Stand!"

- **Scouting reports**:
  - "Found fresh rubs all over the ridge"
  - Photos of sign (tracks, scrapes, bedding areas)
  - Intelligence sharing: "Acorns are dropping heavy on north side"
  - Pattern sharing: "Does are feeding in the beans every evening around 5:30pm"

#### **B. Content Types that Matter**

- **Photos**:
  - The sunrise from your stand
  - Fresh sign you found
  - The spread you're cooking at camp
  - Gear you're testing
  - New stand construction progress
  - Food plot growth

- **Videos**:
  - Trail cam clips (the auto-triggered kind)
  - Calling sequences (for teaching)
  - The approach to your stand (quiet route demo)
  - Shot footage (where legal/appropriate)
  - Buck behavior clips
  - Turkey strutting

- **"Here's What I Learned" posts**:
  - Tactical lessons from failed hunts
  - Gear reviews (what worked, what didn't)
  - Scent control experiments
  - Weather pattern observations
  - Moon phase correlations you've noticed

- **Historical throwbacks**:
  - "This day 5 years ago, I shot my best buck from this same stand"
  - Old camp photos from before the new guys joined
  - "Remember when we built this stand? Here's the build pics"

#### **C. Social Features - The Brotherhood Stuff**

- **Reactions** (but keep it hunting-focused):
  - 🦌 = Nice buck!
  - 🎯 = Great shot!
  - 💪 = Beast mode!
  - 🔥 = On fire!
  - 🙏 = Respect
  - 😂 = Classic hunting humor

- **Comments**:
  - Real conversations, not just emoji spam
  - Tell your own version of that story
  - Give advice: "Try calling sequence XYZ next time"
  - Ask questions: "What time did you see that buck?"

- **Tags**:
  - Tag members who were there: "Thanks @Jim for helping drag this beast"
  - Tag stands: "From #OakRidge"
  - Tag species: #Whitetail #8Point
  - Tag conditions: #NorthWind #ColdFront #RutPhase

- **Sharing**:
  - Share to your personal social media (if you want)
  - Keep it private to club by default
  - Option to make specific posts public (for recruitment)

#### **D. The "Hot Stand" Board**

Real-time intelligence everyone wants to know.

- **Recent activity by stand**:
  - "Oak Stand: 3 sightings in last 7 days"
  - "Creek Bottom: No activity last 2 weeks"
  - "South Ridge: 2 bucks spotted yesterday evening"

- **Success rates displayed**:
  - "Oak Stand: 4 harvests this season (highest in club)"
  - "North food plot: 60% success rate this month"

- **Current conditions**:
  - "Wind is perfect for Oak Stand right now"
  - "Barometer just dropped 0.15" - bucks should be moving"
  - "Moon rises at 3:47pm - expect late afternoon movement"

#### **E. Respecting the Harvest**

Because not everyone needs to see dead animals.

- **Tasteful harvest photos**:
  - Guidelines for respectful presentation
  - No grip-and-grin gore shots
  - Focus on the hunter's accomplishment, not shock value
  - Option to blur graphic content (blood, etc.)
  - Educational context ("Clean shot placement through the vitals")

- **Privacy settings**:
  - Keep harvest photos club-only
  - Don't auto-share to public
  - Respect non-hunters in members' lives

**Hunter Stories:**
- *"I just had the most insane sit. Buck chasing does everywhere but just out of range. I need to tell someone!"*
- *"Trail cam photo from last night shows a monster. Everyone's going to want to see this."*
- *"I've been hunting this property for 20 years. Here's what I've learned about the November cold fronts..."*
- *"First-time member wants to know where to start. Let's show him what we've been seeing this week."*

### 8. The Brotherhood Competition 🏆

**The Problem We're Solving:**
Hunting clubs thrive on friendly competition. Who shot the biggest buck? Who's put in the most time? Who's the best shot? We already talk about it around the fire. Let's make it official (and fun).

**What Makes Competition Fun:**

#### **A. Leaderboards That Matter**

These aren't arbitrary rankings. These measure things hunters actually care about.

**Season Leaderboards:**

- **Biggest Buck** (Boone & Crockett score)
  - Auto-calculated from harvest measurements
  - Typical and non-typical categories
  - Separate boards for rifle/bow/muzzleloader

- **Heaviest Deer** (field-dressed weight)
  - Track the real tanks
  - Compare by weapon type

- **Most Points** (antler points)
  - The guy who always finds the weird 12-pointers

### 9. Scouting & Intelligence Network 🔍

**The Problem We're Solving:**
Knowledge is power. One guy sees a giant buck on trail cam. Another guy finds a scrape line. Someone else patterns the does feeding in the beans. But nobody's connecting the dots. We need to share intel like a tactical unit.

**What Real Scouting Looks Like:**

#### **A. Trail Camera Central**

Trail cams are our eyes in the woods 24/7. Make them actually useful.

- **Upload trail cam photos**:
  - Direct upload from SD card or phone app
  - Auto-read EXIF data (date, time, camera location)
  - Organize by camera location
  - Tag date/time automatically

- **Mark on the map**:
  - Every camera pinned to exact GPS location
  - Click camera marker to see its recent photos
  - Know which cameras haven't been checked recently
  - Battery change schedule reminders

- **AI photo tagging** (this is the future):
  - Auto-detect: Deer, buck, doe, fawn, turkey, hog, coyote, etc.
  - Count points on bucks
  - Estimate age class
  - Track individual bucks over time (pattern recognition)
  - "This is the same 8-point from Camera 3 last week"

- **Activity analysis**:
  - Peak movement times per camera
  - Moon phase correlation
  - Weather pattern correlation
  - "This camera shows most activity between 6:30-8:00am"

- **Share the best ones**:
  - Post highlight photos to camp feed
  - "Check out this bruiser from Camera 4 last night!"
  - Generate excitement for upcoming hunts

#### **B. Deer Movement Intel**

Connect the sightings to understand patterns.

- **Sighting reports** (even if you don't shoot):
  - "Saw 3 does and a 6-point at 7:15am from Oak Stand"
  - Log every deer you see, not just harvests
  - Direction of travel
  - What they were doing (feeding, bedding, cruising)
  - Which way they came from / went to

- **Pattern mapping**:
  - System plots all sightings on map
  - Heat map shows where deer are being seen most
  - Travel corridor identification
  - "Deer are moving from bedding area to food plot via this ridge"

- **Behavioral tracking**:
  - **Pre-rut**: Bucks in bachelor groups
  - **Seeking phase**: Bucks cruising alone
  - **Chasing phase**: Bucks running does
  - **Lockdown**: Bucks with does, hard to pattern
  - **Post-rut**: Bucks back on food sources

- **Rut indicators**:
  - Scrape locations marked on map
  - Rub lines documented with photos
  - "Active scrape" status tracking
  - Primary vs. secondary scrapes
  - Community scrapes (the big ones all bucks hit)

#### **C. Sign Documentation**

Physical evidence in the woods.

- **Tracks**:
  - Photo with ruler for scale
  - GPS pin location
  - Estimated size (direction of travel)
  - Fresh vs. old
  - "Found a monster track headed toward Creek Bottom"

- **Rubs**:
  - Photo from multiple angles
  - Tree diameter (bigger trees = bigger bucks)
  - Height of rub (shoulder height indicator)
  - Freshness
  - Direction of travel from rub pattern

- **Scrapes**:
  - Photo of scrape
  - Diameter measurement
  - Active or old
  - Licking branch condition
  - "Freshened up daily" vs. "hit occasionally"

- **Bedding areas**:
  - Document but don't over-pressure
  - Mark on map with "Do not disturb" zone
  - Approach routes that avoid bedding

- **Trails**:
  - Main trails vs. secondary trails
  - Width (more traffic = wider)
  - Fresh tracks = active trail
  - Connect bedding to food sources

#### **D. Food Source Tracking**

Deer gotta eat. Track what's hot.

- **Natural food sources**:
  - Oak tree locations (mark each tree)
  - Acorn drop timing (which trees dropping first)
  - Persimmon trees
  - Apple trees
  - Honeysuckle patches
  - Browse plants
  - "White oaks on south ridge just started dropping - hunt there!"

- **Ag field monitoring** (if you border farms):
  - What's planted (corn, beans, wheat)
  - When it's harvested
  - Deer feeding patterns in fields
  - "Beans are turning yellow - deer will be hammering them"

- **Food plot intel**:
  - Which plots deer are using
  - Time of day they're feeding
  - How many deer per evening
  - "North plot: 12 deer last 3 evenings from 6-7pm"

- **Seasonal shifts**:
  - Early season: Soybeans and soft mast
  - Mid season: Acorns and food plots
  - Late season: Standing corn and brassicas
  - Track the transitions

#### **E. Weather & Moon Intelligence**

Because conditions matter as much as location.

- **Barometric pressure tracking**:
  - Pressure drops = increased movement
  - Stable high pressure = daytime bedding
  - "Barometer dropping 0.2" today - expect afternoon action"

- **Cold front alerts**:
  - "Cold front moving in tonight - tomorrow morning will be hot!"
  - Temperature drops = increased feeding
  - First cold snaps of fall = best hunting

- **Wind analysis**:
  - Track which stands are huntable in which wind directions
  - "NW wind - hunt Creek Stand or South Ridge"
  - Thermal current notes (morning vs evening)

- **Moon phase correlation**:
  - Track harvest success by moon phase
  - Overhead/underfoot times
  - "Last 3 years, most bucks harvested during waning crescent"
  - Some guys swear by it, some don't - track your own data

- **Precipitation impact**:
  - Before rain: Increased movement
  - During rain: Bedded unless heavy rut
  - After rain: Great tracking conditions, fresh sign visible
  - Snow: Jackpot for tracking, see exactly where they're moving

#### **F. Shared Hunting Calendar**

Beyond just booking stands - share your plans.

- **Hunt plan sharing** (optional):
  - "I'm hunting Oak Stand Saturday morning, then moving to Creek Bottom in the evening"
  - Helps others plan around you
  - Can coordinate drives or pushes

- **Group hunt coordination**:
  - Organize doe management drives
  - Push troublesome areas
  - Turkey hunting pairs
  - "Need 4 guys for a hog hunt Saturday - who's in?"

- **Off-property opportunities**:
  - "Public land opener - who wants to team up?"
  - "Out-of-state trip planning"
  - "Turkey hunting in Missouri - got extra spots"

**Hunter Stories:**
- *"Found a massive scrape next to the oak grove. Marked it on the map. Everyone should check it out."*
- *"Trail cam photos show the same big 10-point hitting Camera 4 every morning at 7:20am this week."*
- *"White oaks on north ridge are dropping HEAVY. That's where I'd hunt this weekend."*
- *"Barometer is dropping tonight. Cold front tomorrow. I'm taking the day off work to hunt."*
- *"We've got 4 different sightings of a big 8-point in the south end. Let's compare notes and figure out his pattern."*

### 12. The Financial Command Center 💰

**The Problem We're Solving:**
Club treasurers are volunteers trying to track money in spreadsheets while also working full-time jobs and trying to hunt. Late payments. Missing receipts. Nobody knows the budget. Arguments over spending. The money side of camp shouldn't be this hard.

- **Auto-reminders**:
  - 30 days before due: "Dues coming up soon"
  - 7 days before due: "Dues due next week"
  - Day of: "Dues are due today"
